  Hello World! I am Zach Cannon and this is my portfolio site.I am currently a web services engineer at Digital Monitoring products where I work mostly in AngularJS Development and have recently begun Ruby on Rails Development.
  This site will serve as a blog and run the gambit on topics. I will cover career, technology and a grab bag of other topics so hop along for the ride. Without further babbling I will get into about myself. In a future post I will detail my idea for how the blog will work and receive actual input from my readers.

  I graduated from Missouri State University in Springfield, MO with a B.S in Computer Information Systems. Go Bears. I have been working since high school slowly working my way up to my current position. More to come in a later blog post.
  I have a beautiful wife, son and dog and they are the world to me. We enjoy doing everything together as a family but by taking family road trips take the cake.
  Hobbies and interest outside of technology include sports (primarily football and basketball), video games and being outdoors (hiking and floating). I hope to delve more into these topics in future posts!
